## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python and Django installed on your system.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**  
   Open a terminal and move into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd project4
   ```

3. **Apply Migrations**  
   Run the following commands to set up the database:
   ```sh
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Run the Server**  
   Start the Django development server:
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Features

### 1. User Authentication
- Users can register, log in, and log out.
- Authentication is handled using Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system.

### 2. Posting
- Signed-in users can create new text-based posts.
- Posts appear on the "All Posts" page in reverse chronological order.

### 3. Profile Pages
- Each user has a profile page displaying:
  - Their posts.
  - Number of followers and followings.
  - A "Follow" or "Unfollow" button for signed-in users viewing other profiles.

### 4. Following Feed
- Signed-in users can view posts made by users they follow.
- Functions like the "All Posts" page but displays only followed users' posts.

### 5. Pagination
- Posts are paginated, displaying 10 per page.
- "Next" and "Previous" buttons allow navigation between pages.

### 6. Post Editing
- Users can edit their own posts.
- Editing is done in-line using JavaScript and does not require a page reload.
- Only the original author of a post can edit it.

### 7. Like and Unlike Posts
- Users can like and unlike posts.
- The like count updates asynchronously using JavaScript and fetch API.
- Users cannot like their own posts.
